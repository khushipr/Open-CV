# OpenCV

OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.

## Computer Vision

Computer vision is a process by which we can understand the images and videos how they are stored and how we can manipulate and retrieve data from them. Computer Vision is the base or mostly used for Artificial Intelligence. Computer-Vision is playing a major role in self-driving cars, robotics as well as in photo correction apps. 

Computer Vision overlaps significantly with the following fields −

- **Image Processing** − It focuses on image manipulation.

- **Pattern Recognition** − It explains various techniques to classify patterns.

- **Photogrammetry** − It is concerned with obtaining accurate measurements from images.

## Features of OpenCV Library

Using OpenCV library, you can −

- Read and write images

- Capture and save videos

- Process images (filter, transform)

- Perform feature detection

- Detect specific objects such as faces, eyes, cars, in the videos or images.

- Analyze the video, i.e., estimate the motion in it, subtract the background, and track objects in it.
